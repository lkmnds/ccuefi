==========================

**UEFI**(*Wikipedia*) - The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing legacy support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.

**CCUEFI** Is the ComputerCraft version of UEFI, it is made to make multiboot simple(Including booting by an external media), it defines all things a firmware must do to run CCUEFI-compatible operating systems.
